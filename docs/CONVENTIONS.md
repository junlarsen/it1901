# Developer Conventions

Here are the naming conventions that the team uses for the GitLab Workflow.

1. All issues are attached to the relevant GitLab Milestone
2. All merge requests are attached to the relevant GitLab milestone
3. All merge requests are squash merged
4. Merge requests are merged only by the person opening them
5. Merge requests that are non-trivial should have an approving review
6. All commits are pushed to non-main branches
7. All issues are tagged as `task` or `user story`
8. All task issues are given priority and effort labels

Branch names follow the scheme `[feat|fix|refactor|docs]/#[issue number]-[some-name]`
